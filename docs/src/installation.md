# Installation ðŸ“¥

## 1. Download and install Blender
Blender is a cross-platform, licensed-free 3D content creation software, developed by people all over the world.  

[Download Blender 3.6 LTS](https://www.blender.org/download/lts/3-6/){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

??? question "Why LTS?"
    Transmogrifier is developed specifically for long-term support (LTS) versions of Blender.  These are branches of the software which receive optimizations and stability improvements over 2-year cycles.  We develop Transmogrifier for Blender LTS because it reduces our having to play "catch-up" with incremental changes to Blender's API, thus allowing us to focus more on developing add-on itself.  
    
    **Transmogrifier may work on non-LTS versions >3.6, but this is not guaranteed.**

<!-- 
!!! example "Operating Systems"
    Transmogrifier is developed on Windows & Ubuntu.  It ought to work just fine on MacOS, but this has not been tested. -->
