When it finds a file, it clears out all the current data blocks in the scene, imports the file, imports the associated textures, creates material(s), assigns that/those material(s) to the object(s) in the scene, and exports the model in the new format specified. If Auto File Resizing is turned on, Transmogrifier will then check the exported file's size and attempt to resize the file. The process then repeats until it has converted all files of the specified import format in the given directory.</p> <p>The diagram below shows the general process and the variety of ways in which Transmogrifier can convert models with respect to available textures and the chosen import and export formats.

Transparent pieces have \"transparent\" in name and are separate objects. Objects that should appear transparent must have the word \"transparent\" present somewhere in their names. This indicates to Transmogrifier that it should duplicate the material as \"[material]_transparent\" and turn on \"Alpha Blend\" blending mode, then assign \"[material]\" to the opaque objects and \"[material]_transparent\" to the transparent objects. This convention works for multiple texture sets as well.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Per item, if only 1 texture set is present, object names don't matter except for Rule 1. For \"External\" and \"Custom\" texture sources and for models with only one texture set present, the first rule doesn't matter because it is assumed that that texture set should be applied to all the objects in the scene. </li> </ol> <p></p> <ol> <li>Per item, if &gt;1 texture set is present and textures source is either \"External\" or \"Custom\", object and textures set names do matter: an object's name must include its corresponding texture set name somewhere in the object's name. For models with more than one texture set present, a texture set naming convention must also be followed for Transmogrifier to correctly import and assign multiple texture sets to the proper objects. Simply ensure that the the first word before an underscore or another separator in the textures' names is 1) distinct between texture sets and 2) consistent between i.) each PBR image in each texture set and ii.) between the texture sets and the objects to which those textures should be applied (See image below). As such, having multiple materials assigned to different meshes within an object is not possible. For \"Packed\" textures source, Transmogrifier automatically keeps associated materials, textures, and objects synchronized. </li> </ol> <p></p>"},{"location":"#resolution","title":"Resolution:","text":"<p>Resize textures and filter what to include by PBR type.
