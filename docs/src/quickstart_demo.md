## 1. Download the Demo Files
Download the demo files, then unzip the folder.  Inside you will find 3D models as FBX files along with their associated textures.

[Download PolyHaven Demo Files](https://github.com/SapwoodStudio/Transmogrifier/releases/latest/download/PolyHaven_Demo_Files.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

!!! info "PolyHaven"
    [PolyHaven](https://polyhaven.com/) is a creative-commons (CC0) library of models, textures and HDRI's.  We've curated 5 models with textures from their library for this demo.


## 2. Add Import
Click `+ Add Import` to add an import file format for Transmogrifier to search for.  Leave the format in its default value (`FBX`).

Click on the folder icon at the bottom of the `Imports` box.  In the pop-up file dialog, double-click into the unzipped "PolyHaven_Demo_Files" folder and click `Accept`.

## 5. Check the `Forecast`
Click the `Forecast` button to predict the batch conversion.  In this case, Transmogrifier should find 5 `FBX` files in the PolyHaven_Demo_Files folder which will then be converted to 5 `GLB` files in the next step.

## 6. Click `Batch Convert`
Finally, click `Batch Convert` and let the process run.  When it finishes, you should now be able to find 5 `GLB` files, one in each model's folder.  

!!! info
    After this button is clicked, a second Blender window will pop-up.  This window will be greyed-out, and both this and the original Blender window will remain unresponsive until the batch conversion is over.  This is normal operation.
